BDI Agent Programming with AgentSpeak. Agents act and communicate within an environment where they must collect resources and avoid obstacles. Implementation of A* search algorithm for navigation.

## How to run
The easiest way to run this project is to download the Jason IDE, and run the five scenarios within it.

### Requirements
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) 1.8 or greater is required.

1. Extract the files to a directory of your choice.
2. Navigate to the folder *jedit* and double click on *jedit.jar*.
3. Within the IDE navigate to *Plugins -> Plugins Options -> Jason*.
4. Set the *jason.jar* location.
5. Set the directory *libs* as the Ant libs.
6. Set the *jade.jar* location.

### Select a scenario
- Navigate to *File -> Open* and choose one of the .mas2j files in the github repository such as *scenario_1.mas2j*.
- Click the green arrow in the bottom right of the IDE to run the scenario.
